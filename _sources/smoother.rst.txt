Biharmonic Smoother
===================

To reduce speckling the velocity fields of coarse resolution SAM, we add a
biharmonic smoother. I got the code from Matt Wyant. The only modification I
made was to make the hypdediffusivity a namelist constant with a default value
of 1e16 which is 10 times higher than recommended for this resolution in [Jablonowski]_.
